    "problem": "Many of the processes required to support a Client are too costly – usually because of the manual labor costs – to support the current number of clients, let alone increasing it. For example, the Investor Sales unit has decided to stop doing business with low-revenue clients because the cost of maintaining those clients is greater than the generated revenue. Similarly, credit lines are cut and legal agreements cancelled",

    "problem": "Currently, clients of ICG mostly use off-line methods to interact with Citi.  This leads to client choosing more advanced banks and non-banks, frequent Client escalations over delays and data loss leading to one-off emergency work and Citi’s inability to service requests in time",
